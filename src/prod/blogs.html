                      Okay so this is kind of different story here, kind of late
                      for the halloween mood but what ever.<br />
                      Recently i came to a realization that what i thought was
                      nothing, was actually something pretty big, i've always
                      dissmised these events that i'm about to share, as a
                      childish things, didn't gave much of a thought.
                      <br />
                      But then i connected some stuff, maybe what i was
                      witnessing as a chlid, and the sigh im hearing, was all in
                      my head.
                      <br />
                      Okay, starting from the earliest thing i remember, was a
                      demonic voice calling my name and then laughs 4 times. I
                      dont know why but I perfectly clearly remember the laugh.
                      I can still hear it in my head if I try to remember it.
                      The voice sounded like it was in my room. I was about 6-8
                      years old then.
                      <br />
                      Then, several years later, when i was about 12-14, i had
                      what i thought poletergeist or some sort of ghosts
                      activity. I heared literal running in the house, when i
                      was home alome, not only that, but I heared as the ball
                      dropped and it bounce several times. We had no ball
                      whatsoever, and definetly not basketball or something that
                      heavy.
                      <br />
                      Somewhere in between those years, I visited my cousin for
                      summer vacation. He lived in the UK with his mother. He
                      was a year older than me. I remember the first night, I
                      was awoken, but i dont know why, and I see the curtains
                      literally jumping up and down, left and right. I rubbed my
                      eyes and checking if it was real (literally rubbed my eyes
                      from disbelief). I then try to wake my cousin up, but when
                      he awakes, the curtains stops moving. My eyes are glued to
                      the curtains, I cant stop looking at them, but as soon as
                      he tells me theres nothing there and goes to sleep, the
                      curtains moves again. It happened for several times before
                      i went to sleep (I cant remember past this point).
                      <br />
                      I remember then, some nights later, I had something
                      simmilar happened, i dont know how i was awoken at night,
                      i cant remember that, but I was seeing something in the
                      window, that was a full view, and heared a witch-like
                      laugh, then the shadow flew away. (Im not even believing
                      myself as I'm writing this, thats how crazy it sounds).
                      <br />
                      From this point onwards im not aware that I hallucinated
                      visually anymore, however I had some pretty noticeable
                      audio hallucinations. I pretty often used to hear an
                      audible sigh, coming from somewher in the house of. Of
                      course i dismissed it as its definetly has to do something
                      with the heating or the pipes. Didnt gave much thought,
                      just annoyed me thats all. But recently, last year as of
                      this writing, I heared THE SAME EXACT sigh in the office I
                      was working from. At first I thought that was weird, but
                      didnt gave much thought about it, until I made realization
                      that its the same sound that annoyed me in the house. The
                      pitch is the same... I dont know how to explain it, it was
                      very distinct sigh...
                      <br />
                      I don't hear the sigh anymore, the office was the last
                      place I heared it. Maybe it's nothing, I hope it's nothing
                      and I'm overreacting.
                      <br />
                      Maybe I'm wrong, maybe it is just childish dreams and
                      nothing more. I just recently made the posible connection
                      myself, that the sigh might has something to do with my
                      previous unexplained things like those 'ghost' stuff.
                      <br />
                      P.S these 'ghost' stuff happened 3 times in total, I don't
                      wanna get into details very much, as it would reveal my
                      fucked up childhood, where I lived in the foster home,
                      had/have abusive parents, and other stuff that im not
                      ready to talk about.

                      I started to work on a multiplayer game. The game itself
                      won't be for a full release, it's more for a learning
                      purpose than actually releasing a full developed game. Of
                      course, i want to make a functional game, but that all the
                      game will be, just functional, for now.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      The development of the game will serve the learning
                      purpose. I'm looking to learn about game servers, how
                      servers manage players input, and sending the response
                      back to client. Basically server-client proccess of
                      multiplayer game.
                      <br />
                      For server side development, I use C language, and let me
                      tell you, developing server, or anything basically in pure
                      C, is one hell of a thing to do. The amount stuff one have
                      to do manually, is concerning. Now i will definetly
                      appriaciate not having to deal with strings manually when
                      i use anything else than C XD.

                          Have players moving around and have the player
                          movements showed to other players.

                      For a reference, im using maple story, an 2000s 2D
                      multiplayer game. I like the simplistic style of it, and
                      the fact that is 2D

                      OMG. I have no words, the world, the characters,
                      everything is perfect. Jinx/Powder is incredibly
                      relatable, one of my favourites characters of all medium,
                      i love her so much. I even considering setting this
                      website's thematic to the arcane one.

                      I've finally started working on my own website. I got the
                      style i wanted, scouted the neocity througly, encountered
                      some really obscure sites. The web surfing invoked a
                      strange feeling in me, i can't explain it, but I felt like
                      im at home.
